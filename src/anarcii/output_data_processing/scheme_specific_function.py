    # We gap the CDR1 in a heuristic way using the gaps.

    # This means that CDR1 gapping will not always be correct. For example if one grafts
    # a Kappa CDR1 loop onto a Lambda framework the gapping patter might now be
    # incorrect. Not a fan of being so prescriptive.

    # The CDR1 region included here ranges from AHo 25 to AHo 42 inclusive

    # The order in which the two loops are gapped is dependent on the chain type (see
    # alignments in URLs above). Not all lengths are defined as not all lengths were
    # crystallised in 2001 (or today). Where no example of the length was available the
    # rule followed is to continue gapping the C terminal 'loop', then the N terminal
    # 'loop', then 31 then the fw. In all cases I have commented where the gapping is
    # undefined. Note that for alpha chains the gapping rules are inconsistent.
